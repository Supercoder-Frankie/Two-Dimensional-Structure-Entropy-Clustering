# Two-Dimensional-Structure-Entropy-Clustering
This repository demonstrates how two-dimensional structure entropy clustering works and the outcomes.
The basic idea of the algorithm is: Entropy is used to measure the amount of information contained in a structure. By dividing the structure and using random walk, the community detection is realized by calculating the average code length under steady-state distribution.
